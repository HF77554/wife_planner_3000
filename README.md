tongue-in-cheek project for help in the daily life. We moved to a new place and my wife has a long set of chores for me. Instead of going bit by bit I want to create a todo list which I can improve in overtime. 

Current criteria:
Site must be accessible by two different users under one auth [one combined sign in with two users?]

Todo items must have a name, description, and date posted

Todo items must have three settings: pending, in progress, awaiting confirmation. 
    pending: husband has not started the item
    in progress: husband has seen the item and started work on item.
    awating confirmation: husband has finished item, wife[original creator] must sign off on duty

Items on list must be able to be dragged to ensure wife priority order is met
**For urgent element color code element in list to RED

*Sign-in user(wife) creates room, user(wife) sends invite to other user(husband)
